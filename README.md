# JavaGame
This game contains an interactive menu with two different minigames. 
The first is a Frogger-like game, where you are a character trying to avoid moving obstacles whilst trying to gather enough stars to reach the end of the level.
The second is called "Asteroid Rush" a game where you must collect the greatest amount of points possible before you can get hit by one of the asteroids being generated.
The HSA FSA console was used to generate the game in this case.
